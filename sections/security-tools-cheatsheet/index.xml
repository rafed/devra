And it&amp;rsquo;s so easy to use that even you could claim to be a hacker just by running a few commands. Also, it is incredibly powerful as well. This guide is a general overview of how Metasploit can be used.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Pentesting with Nmap the Network Testing Tool (with Cheat Sheets)</title><link>https://rafed.github.io/devra/sections/security-tools-cheatsheet/nmap-cheatsheet/</link><pubDate>Tue, 21 Sep 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://rafed.github.io/devra/sections/security-tools-cheatsheet/nmap-cheatsheet/</guid><description>&lt;p>Nmap is a CLI based port scanner. As modern networking relies heavily on TCP ports, scanning these ports can expose valuable and critical data about a device on the network. These data can then be used to understand where vulnerabilities lie and how potential hackers can use them. Thus learning to port scan using Nmap is one of the first things a security researcher needs to grasp.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
