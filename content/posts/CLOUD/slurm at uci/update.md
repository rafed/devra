```diff
## Progres
+ Got access to opengpu.p cluster by ics
+ Can run gpu on the cluster (CUDA 11.7)
+ 4 GPU (12 GB RAM each)

## Problems
- CUDA errors
- Bleeding edge libraries are buggy
- APIs try to load model on a single GPU
- - Cannot distribute model to multiple GPUs

## Todo
+ Run quantized models by distributing on GPU && CPU
```
