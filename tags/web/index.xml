The qualities that make a domain good are:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Short name&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Easy to remember&lt;/li>

After I discovered blogger.com, I thought I could improve my blogging experience with it. So I made the switch and these were my reasons.&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>I couldn&amp;rsquo;t find a suitable Jekyll theme for my blog. So I made one for myself. Not being a good UI designer, I made a pretty bad theme. With Blogger.com&amp;rsquo;s WYSIWYG editor I thought I could make a better looking site.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>I liked managing blog posts in the browser rather than with a text editor locally.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The fact that my blog was in the cloud and I could access it from any PC was appealing. With Github pages I was limited to my local machine. Working from other PCs is possible but it required the hassle of git clones and git configs.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Blogger.com comes with a neat mobile app that makes writing on the go possible (even offline).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Blogger.com has inbuilt support for comments and user analytics. In Github pages plugins (such as disqus and google analytics) were required.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>Blogger seemed like the appropriate platform for me. But after publishing about 20 posts problems started popping out.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Fix Bulma Mobile View Problem</title><link>https://rafed.github.io/devra/posts/web/fix-bulma-mobile-view-problem/</link><pubDate>Sat, 16 May 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://rafed.github.io/devra/posts/web/fix-bulma-mobile-view-problem/</guid><description>&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve been working with bulma for a while.
