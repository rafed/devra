And it&amp;rsquo;s so easy to use that even you could claim to be a hacker just by running a few commands. Also, it is incredibly powerful as well. This guide is a general overview of how Metasploit can be used.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Pentesting with Nmap the Network Testing Tool (with Cheat Sheets)</title><link>https://rafed.github.io/devra/sections/security-tools-cheatsheet/nmap-cheatsheet/</link><pubDate>Tue, 21 Sep 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://rafed.github.io/devra/sections/security-tools-cheatsheet/nmap-cheatsheet/</guid><description>&lt;p>Nmap is a CLI based port scanner. As modern networking relies heavily on TCP ports, scanning these ports can expose valuable and critical data about a device on the network. These data can then be used to understand where vulnerabilities lie and how potential hackers can use them. Thus learning to port scan using Nmap is one of the first things a security researcher needs to grasp.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>7 Vulnerable Applications for Practicing Pentesting</title><link>https://rafed.github.io/devra/posts/security/vulnerable-applications-for-practicing-pentesting/</link><pubDate>Sat, 18 Jul 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://rafed.github.io/devra/posts/security/vulnerable-applications-for-practicing-pentesting/</guid><description>&lt;p>The best way to learn security concepts is by doing it.

What does bother me is that people spread fake news and some idiots believe them.

Although I occasionally goof around with CTFs, I&amp;rsquo;m no expert at it. Despite this, I decided to take an attempt. I was skeptical at first but it turned out to be an awesome experience.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Kali as a Regular Operating System</title><link>https://rafed.github.io/devra/posts/security/kali-as-regular-os/</link><pubDate>Tue, 25 Jun 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://rafed.github.io/devra/posts/security/kali-as-regular-os/</guid><description>&lt;p>If you are an aspiring pentester you should definitely use Kali Linux and make it your primary OS. Switching to a new OS can be a very hard decision to make. Concerns such as whether you can do your regular work may rise. It has been quite a while (3 years) since I am using Kali as my primary OS and here are my experiences with it.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>How to be a Hacker with Kali</title><link>https://rafed.github.io/devra/posts/security/be-hacker-with-kali/</link><pubDate>Sat, 22 Jun 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://rafed.github.io/devra/posts/security/be-hacker-with-kali/</guid><description>&lt;p>If you&amp;rsquo;ve discovered Kali Linux and thinking about how you can hack with it, you probably can&amp;rsquo;t and youâ€™re probably walking in the wrong direction.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Kali is not a magic OS that can hack everything. It is just an operating system that comes with preinstalled pentesting tools. Now, you really cannot expect a tool to do everything by itself. You need to understand when it works, where it works, and how it works.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>5 Reasons Why Linux Needs No Antivirus</title><link>https://rafed.github.io/devra/posts/security/why-linux-needs-no-antivirus/</link><pubDate>Sun, 09 Jul 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://rafed.github.io/devra/posts/security/why-linux-needs-no-antivirus/</guid><description>&lt;p>So, maybe you have heard Linux PCs are super safe because they are not affected by viruses. Linux computers are almost immune to viruses. Yes, I said &amp;ldquo;almost&amp;rdquo; immune. But the percentage of PCs being affected is very less, even less than 1%. That is why people say that Linux does not need any antivirus. But why is that have you ever wondered? Here are the top 5 reasons why viruses do not affect Linux.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
