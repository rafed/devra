While most of the documentation is quite clear, I noticed that there is a lack of detailed guidance on utilizing the OpenGPU cluster.</description></item><item><title>AWS S3 Cannot Delete Objects (even with Full S3 Permissions)</title><link>https://rafed.github.io/devra/posts/cloud/aws/aws-s3-cannot-delete-object/</link><pubDate>Wed, 07 Sep 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://rafed.github.io/devra/posts/cloud/aws/aws-s3-cannot-delete-object/</guid><description>I pulled my hair for 3 hours before solving this. Now here&amp;rsquo;s the solution so that you don&amp;rsquo;t have to pull yours.
Here&amp;rsquo;s the scenario:
There is a S3 bucket There is an IAM user whose purpose is to access the bucket (create/update/delete objects) The IAM user has full S3 permissions on the bucket The IAM user can create/update objects but cannot delete objects (WTF?</description></item><item><title>Django Metrics, Logs &amp; Traces Observability with Opentelemetry and Grafana</title><link>https://rafed.github.io/devra/posts/cloud/django-mlt-observability-with-opentelemetry/</link><pubDate>Wed, 11 May 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://rafed.github.io/devra/posts/cloud/django-mlt-observability-with-opentelemetry/</guid><description>Metrics, Logs and Traces (MLT) are the three pillars of observability that can provide us with complete visibility of a software system.

That means if a pod crashes or restarts then the data stored previously is lost. Volumes in Kubernetes decouple storage from pods and provides a method for persisting data.
For persistent storage in Kubernetes, we need to know 3 things.</description></item><item><title>#02 - Kubernetes Networking</title><link>https://rafed.github.io/devra/sections/kubernetes-minified-simplified/2.-kubernetes-networking/</link><pubDate>Fri, 13 Aug 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://rafed.github.io/devra/sections/kubernetes-minified-simplified/2.-kubernetes-networking/</guid><description>Kubernetes is a container orchestration platform. It is used to help containers in a cluster communicate between them in an easy way. This is where networking in Kubernetes kicks in.
